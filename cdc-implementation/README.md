# CDC Implementation

## Deploy the CDK code

```shell
cdk deploy CdcStack
```
After about 5-10 mins, the deployment will complete and the Application Load Balancer URL will be printed.

## Happy Path

1. Append `swagger-ui/index.html` to the ALB URL to access the Swagger page in your browser:

![SwaggerPage](../img/cdc-swagger-page.png)

2. Let's book a first flight ticket from Paris to London (you can replace the departure, destination and dates/times as you desire):
```json
{
    "departureAirport": "Paris",
    "arrivalAirport": "London",
    "departureDateTime": "2023-09-01T08:00:00.000Z",
    "arrivalDateTime": "2023-09-01T08:15:00.000Z"
}
```

After a few seconds, the flight event is processed by the Payment service.

3. To view the logs, navigate to the `Elastic Container Service` page of the AWS Console. - Click on `Clusters` in the left pane and then click on the Cluster you just deployed.

4. In the `Services` tab, click on the service you just created and then navigate to the `Logs` tab. If you have trouble finding the relevant log line, you can use the search box to filter for `Processing payment`.

5. To view the flight item in the DynamoDB Table, navigate to the `DynamoDB` page, click on `Tables` in the left pane and then click on the `flight` table in the center of your screen. Then, click on the `Explore table items` button.

6. Because the message is kept in the Kinesis `stream` for 1 day (default value), the `Queue` service is resilient to transient SQS errors by design.

## Cleaning Up

Run the following command to destroy the resources:

```shell
cdk destroy CdcStack
```
